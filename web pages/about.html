<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The Laundry hub organisation announced its formation on 27 January, 2019 in Soweto. 
    The Organistaion was established to help our South African working force with their laundry issue as many of these South Africans would attend work with dirty, smelly clothings leading to bad humidity in work spaces.
    Some of these people live in poor conditions and can't afford a washing machine. 
    This organization was formed by former Youth Enviroment inspector leader Likhaya Zweni.
    The organisation describes itself Clothing and bad, disgusting hygiene exterminator movement for economic emancipation and pleasing hygiene in workplases and homes.</p>
